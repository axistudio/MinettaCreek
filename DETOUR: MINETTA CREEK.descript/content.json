Yet in 1968, she went on an armed rampage - first threatening theatrical producer Margo Feider, who had refused to produce her play. She responded \"Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it.\" She promptly went to the Factory, where she fired three shots at Warhol, another at the art critic Mario Amaya, and tried to shoot Warhol's manager Fred Hughes before her gun jammed. Warhol miraculously survived after a five-hour surgery, and Solanas turned herself in. She told the judge: \"it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me.\"",

Here's Rachel Ghansah's description of what she witnessed in the studio.\n {2014 interview with author Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah}\n“Not too long ago, in Studio A, Foster asked me if I wanted to see the river. I did, and with the help of four almost-silent studio assistants, he rolled Hendrix-era Marshall amps and moved monitors around the large room, pulling off the thick blankets meant to quiet the sound and throwing them in a heap, in order to reach the heavy cellar door. It took all four assistants to lift it. Foster leaned over to tell me he had heard that Jimi Hendrix wanted to stick a microphone into the water and record. Then he said, “I’ve also heard that the Indians here called it the Devil’s Water, but I’ll have to see if that’s true.” Before I could respond with questions, Foster was sitting in a rocky hole in the earth, and right below his sooty cowboy boots was indeed water—rushing clear and steady. It was the fabled Minetta Creek, a babbling river older than the city itself.” \n\nBy 1828, it was reported that Minetta Creek had been officially diverted to the Hudson through the use of a wooden sewer. Yet instances of flooding continued throughout the 19th century and 20th century, particularly in the early 1900s during the construction of the Manhattan railroad system. It seems Minetta refused to be buried - let's try to catch up to it!",

They were there in abundance, darting to the higher waters like streaks of smoke and flame, against the foamy rush of a narrow channel, or sulking under the shadow of the bank in quiet pool below….”\n\nMinetta Creek snakes its way through lower Manhattan, branching into a swamp, and finally letting out into Hudson. Would you like to follow it? \n{water soundscape, animal soundscape}\n",

Union Place, as it was called in 1828, actually originated as a Native American burial ground. As the city grew, public planners converted the cemetery into a public park, which officially opened on July 19, 1839. The park was inspired by the fashionable residential squares of London, with winding paths through lush grounds around a central circular fountain. In those days, this street was crowded with carriages and horse-drawn trolley cars {soundscape}. Since then, the grounds of Union Square have been used consistently for public meetings, parades and official celebrations. Before the rise of Broadway, this was also the city’s central theater district. In the 1860s, out-of-work actors would lounge around the base of the statue of George Washington, in what was called the \"slave market.\" They'd hang around here, waiting for the various casting agents in the area to run out and offer them bit parts.",

The origins of the name are unknown - some say that the Native Americans who occupied this land called it Manette or Devil's Water. Another theory is that the name is an anglicization of the Dutch root \"min\" or \"minuut\" (little) and suffix \"-tje\" to produce \"Minnetje\" - in other words, \"the little one\" to distinguish it from larger creeks in the area.  The creek had an abundance of wildlife. It was brimming with fish, and the banks were lined with wild muskrats and fowl. {sounds of animal life}. In 1897, George Everett Hill and George E. Waring described in their book, Old Wells and Water-Courses of the Island of Manhattan, as follows:\n\n“a brisk little affair, hurrying along in its well-defined channel, apparently as full of business as it was full of trout. Yes, of trout! They were there in abundance, darting to the higher waters like streaks of smoke and flame, against the foamy rush of a narrow channel, or sulking under the shadow of the bank in quiet pool below….”\n\nMinetta Creek snakes its way through lower Manhattan, branching into a swamp, and finally letting out into Hudson.

The story goes that on the night of her highly anticipated acting debut in New York, the theater where she was due to perform - the New York Park Theatre - burned to the ground, leaving only a charred sign with the words “Lillie Langtry” behind.

Union Place, as it was called in 1828, actually originated as a Native American burial ground. As the city grew, public planners converted the cemetery into a public park, which officially opened on July 19, 1839. The park was inspired by the fashionable residential squares of London, with winding paths through lush grounds around a central circular fountain. In those days, this street was crowded with carriages and horse-drawn trolley cars {soundscape}. Since then, the grounds of Union Square have been used consistently for public meetings, parades and official celebrations. Before the rise of Broadway, this was also the city’s central theater district. In the 1860s, out-of-work actors would lounge around the base of the statue of George Washington, in what was called the \"slave market.\" They'd hang around here, waiting for the various casting agents in the area to run out and offer them bit parts.",

She moved to New York City in the mid-1960s, where she initially made her money through begging and prostitution. Solanas became friends with Warhol, and was part of his circle for a period of seven years, even appearing in two of his films. Yet in 1968, she went on an armed rampage - first threatening theatrical producer Margo Feider, who had refused to produce her play. She responded \"Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it.\" She promptly went to the Factory, where she fired three shots at Warhol, another at the art critic Mario Amaya, and tried to shoot Warhol's manager Fred Hughes before her gun jammed. Warhol miraculously survived after a five-hour surgery, and Solanas turned herself in. She told the judge: \"it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me.\"",

In the early 18th century, it was the place of worship for dissenting Protestants, but was closed and damaged during the Revolution. When it re-opened, it became the first religious organization to receive sanction from the State of New York - so it really was the “First Church.”  The building itself has changed a few times, having suffered two fires, first in 1811, and then again in 1835, in the Great Fire of New York. It's open until quite late - we should head inside and check out the beautiful Gothic interior, built in 1846.",

Here's Rachel Ghansah's description of what she witnessed in the studio.\n {2014 interview with author Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah}\n“Not too long ago, in Studio A, Foster asked me if I wanted to see the river. I did, and with the help of four almost-silent studio assistants, he rolled Hendrix-era Marshall amps and moved monitors around the large room, pulling off the thick blankets meant to quiet the sound and throwing them in a heap, in order to reach the heavy cellar door. It took all four assistants to lift it. Foster leaned over to tell me he had heard that Jimi Hendrix wanted to stick a microphone into the water and record. Then he said, “I’ve also heard that the Indians here called it the Devil’s Water, but I’ll have to see if that’s true.” Before I could respond with questions, Foster was sitting in a rocky hole in the earth, and right below his sooty cowboy boots was indeed water—rushing clear and steady. It was the fabled Minetta Creek, a babbling river older than the city itself.” \n\nBy 1828, it was reported that Minetta Creek had been officially diverted to the Hudson through the use of a wooden sewer. Yet instances of flooding continued throughout the 19th century and 20th century, particularly in the early 1900s during the construction of the Manhattan railroad system. It seems Minetta refused to be buried - let's try to catch up to it!",

In 1917, the painter John Sloan and dadaist Marcel Duchamp broke into the interior staircase of the arch, climbed to the top, fired cap pistols, and declared it the independent republic of New Bohemia.  The fountain here was built in 1960, another reminder of the rich swamplands that used to occupy this area. {soundscape}",
